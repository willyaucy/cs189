Instructions to Reproduce Solutions:

Navigate into the code subdirectory. Open the MATLAB terminal, and run:

To execute q1, run 'q1()' in the terminal.
To execute q2, run 'q2()' in the terminal.
To execute q3, there are two cases:
-- If you want to run k-fold cross validation on C = powers of 10, run 'q3a()'.
-- If you want to see a more elaborate search on C between 10^(-7.5) and 10^(-6.5), with a multi-layer search that narrows this range further down for a few iterations, run 'q3b()'.
-- A description on what these mean can be found in the pdf.
